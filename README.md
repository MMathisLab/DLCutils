# DeepLabCut-Utils 
Various scripts to support [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut). Feel free to contribute your own analysis methods, and perhaps some short notebook of how to use it. Thanks! 


## Example scripts for automation of anlysis & training

These two scripts illustrate how to train, test and analyze videos for multiple projects automatically (scale_raining_and_evaluation.py) and
how to analyze videos that are organized in subfolders automatically (scale_analysis_oversubfolders.py). Feel free to adjust them for your needs!

## DLC1 to DLC 2 conversion code

This code allows you to import the labeled data from DLC 1 to DLC 2 projects. Note, it is not streamlined and should be used with care.

## Running project created on Windows on Colaboratory
#UPDATE: as of Deeplabcut 2.0.4 onwards you no longer need to use this code! You can simply create the training set on the cloud and it will automatically convert your project for you. 

   - This solves a path problem when creating a project and annotating data on Windows (see https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/issues/172). This functionality will be included in 
a later version of DLC 2 (DONE!)
https://github.com/AlexEMG/DLCutils/blob/master/convertWin2Unix.py

*Usage:* change in lines 70 and 71 of https://github.com/AlexEMG/DLCutils/blob/master/convertWin2Unix.py

```basepath='/content/drive/My Drive/DeepLabCut/examples/'``` 

```projectname='Reaching-Mackenzie-2018-08-30'```

then run this script on colaboratory after uploading your labeled data to the drive. Thereby it will be converted
to unix format, then create a training set (with deeplabcut) and proceed as usual...

## Pupil Tracking 
- From Tom Vaissie - tvaissie@scripps.edu
- Please see the README.txt file https://github.com/AlexEMG/DLCutils/tree/master/pupilTracking for details; this code makes the video in case study 7 http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut/. 


Please direct inquires to the **contributors/code-maintainers of that code**. Note that the software(s) are provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied.
